# Supabase Postgres Best Practices

Comprehensive performance optimization guide for Postgres, maintained by Supabase. Contains rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact to guide automated query optimization and schema design.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Writing SQL queries or designing schemas
- Implementing indexes or query optimization
- Reviewing database performance issues
- Configuring connection pooling or scaling
- Optimizing for Postgres-specific features
- Working with Row-Level Security (RLS)

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category                 | Impact      | Prefix      |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1        | Query Performance        | CRITICAL    | `query-`    |
| 2        | Connection Management    | CRITICAL    | `conn-`     |
| 3        | Security & RLS           | CRITICAL    | `security-` |
| 4        | Schema Design            | HIGH        | `schema-`   |
| 5        | Concurrency & Locking    | MEDIUM-HIGH | `lock-`     |
| 6        | Data Access Patterns     | MEDIUM      | `data-`     |
| 7        | Monitoring & Diagnostics | LOW-MEDIUM  | `monitor-`  |
| 8        | Advanced Features        | LOW         | `advanced-` |

## Compact Checklist

- Query performance: inspect `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`, add missing indexes,
  prefer partial/composite/covering indexes when they match real predicates.
- Connection management: keep transactions short, use pooling, avoid idle
  transaction sessions, and batch inserts when possible.
- Security and RLS: index policy predicates, avoid per-row auth function calls,
  and keep privileges least-privileged.
- Schema design: use constraints, stable primary keys, indexed foreign keys, and
  lowercase identifiers.
- Concurrency: avoid long locks, order writes consistently, use advisory locks
  only for explicit cross-row coordination.
- Data access: avoid N+1 queries, use keyset pagination for large lists, and
  design upserts around unique constraints.
- Monitoring: use `pg_stat_statements`, slow query logs, vacuum/analyze checks,
  and query plans before guessing.
